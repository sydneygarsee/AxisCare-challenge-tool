      "I checked the CRM. Your notes are as empty as my faith in your memory.",
      "Imagine a world where you updated your deal notes. Magical, isnâ€™t it?",
      "Iâ€™d call you out by name, but Iâ€™d have to find your notes first.",
      "Plot twist: the real deal was the notes you never wrote.",
      "Did your keyboard break, or did you just forget we track pipeline for a reason?",
      "Hey Sherlock, even Watson updates his deals weekly.",
      "The deals are real. The notes? Not so much.",
      "At this point, I think your notes are hiding from me on purpose.",

      "Iâ€™d ask about your deals, but Iâ€™m not certified in imagination-based forecasting.",
      "If your notes were as consistent as your ghosting, weâ€™d hit 200% quota.",
      "Deal notes are like taxes. Not fun, but required. (Update them.)",
      "Not saying youâ€™re forgetful, but the CRM just sent me a sympathy card.",
      "A gentle reminder: typing 3 sentences wonâ€™t cause physical harm. Try it!",
      "Let me guessâ€”you were going to update your notes â€˜right after this call.â€™",
      "I set a reminder to remind you to remind yourself to take notes. Still waiting.",
      "Quick poll: who thinks [rep name] will remember next week? No one? Cool.",
      "I saw more deal activity in my dreams than I did in your CRM updates.",
      "Please update your notes before the CRM self-deletes in shame.",
      "If I had a dollar for every missed update, Iâ€™d be on a yacht. Without Wi-Fi.",
      "Just checkingâ€”do you only communicate with your pipeline via telepathy?"
