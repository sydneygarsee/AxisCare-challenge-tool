            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "I’m not sure the value justifies the cost."
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “Totally fair—agency owners like you have to think ROI-first. Can I ask—what’s the cost of continuing with your current system or process?”
            <br/>“Most of our customers see a return in just a few months. If we mapped that to your agency, would that help?”
            <em>Pro Tip: Use their client count and payer mix to estimate ROI.</em>

          response = `
            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "Switching sounds painful."
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “Most agencies who switch to AxisCare are coming from [X]—and felt the same. What made them switch was [real differentiator].”
            <em>Pro Tip: Ask what they wish their current system did better, then show how AxisCare handles it.</em>

          response = `
            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "We’re interested, just not right now."
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “What would need to be true for this to become a priority next month?”
            <br/>“A lot of agencies start onboarding now, so they’re not starting from scratch later.”
            <em>Pro Tip: Offer flexible timelines to stay in the deal.</em>

            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "I need internal backup before I commit."
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “Would it be helpful if I joined that convo so I can speak directly to their needs?”
            <br/>“I can send a checklist for what matters most to schedulers, admins, and caregivers.”

            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "I’ve been burned before and I’m cautious."

            “I’m so sorry to hear that. Would you be open to sharing what went wrong?”
            <br/>“We hear that a lot—many agencies say they wish they’d made the switch to AxisCare sooner.”
            <em>Pro Tip: Offer a reference call with a similar client who switched successfully.</em>

          response = `
            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "I want to delay or avoid the decision."
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “If [pain point] continues for 3 more months, what’s the impact?”
            <br/>“Let’s set a check-in for then—and I’ll bring ROI data or client stories to help the case.”

          response = `
            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "You haven’t shown clear business value yet."
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “What’s the biggest operational headache your team deals with?”
            <br/>“AxisCare isn’t just different—it’s a better way to run your agency. Let me show you how [feature] directly solves [pain].”

            <strong>What they mean:</strong> "Compliance is non-negotiable. Can I trust you with it?"
            <strong>How to Respond:</strong>
            “AxisCare is approved in [X states] and supports Medicaid billing workflows in [Y states]. Let’s confirm your state specifics.”
            <em>Pro Tip: Point to EVV compliance page or roadmap where needed.</em>
